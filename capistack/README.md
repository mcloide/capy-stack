# CapiStack

A lightweight Python CI/CD web application for deploying applications from Git repositories via a browser interface.

---

## TL;DR

**CapiStack** is a self-hosted CI/CD platform that keeps things simple, secure, and transparent. It deploys a single app from a Git repo (GitHub, GitLab, or any Git server) to your servers with minimal config. Built with *Python + Flask + SQLAlchemy + RQ*, using a straightforward pipeline: `checkout ‚Üí build ‚Üí deploy ‚Üí post-deploy`.

In plain terms, it‚Äôs an over-glorified `git pull` with a web UI, auth, and logs. And yes‚Äîthe mascot is a cute capybara my youngest picked. ü´∂

### Why another CI/CD?

Using Jenkins to ship a tiny service is overkill. Most other tools felt too complex, too heavy, or too opaque. I wanted a ‚Äúpick a branch ‚Üí deploy ‚Üí see logs‚Äù workflow. Also, I was a little bored.

### What it doesn‚Äôt do (yet)

- Multi-repo or multi-app orchestration (it‚Äôs intentionally single-app for now).
- Server-to-server ‚Äúpromote host A ‚Üí host B‚Äù flows.

It‚Äôs open-source and evolving. If it helps you as much as it helps me, awesome. Run the setup, kick the tires, and if you hit a bug or have an idea, please open an issue or PR.
